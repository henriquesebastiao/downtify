## Features âœ¨

With Downtify you can download Spotify music containing album art, track names, album title and other metadata about the songs. Just copy the Spotify link, whether it's a single song, an album, etc. As soon as your downloads are complete you will be notified!

## Music Sourcing

Downtify uses SpotDL to download music, which in turn uses YouTube as a download source. This method is used to avoid issues related to downloading music from Spotify.

## Usage

### Docker CLI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to change the path `/path/to/downloads` in the command below to the path on your computer where you want to view the downloaded songs.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name downtify -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads henriquesebastiao/downtify
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  downtify:
    container_name: downtify
    image: henriquesebastiao/downtify:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/downloads:/downloads
    environment:
