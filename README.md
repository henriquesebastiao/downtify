## Features

With Downtify you can download Spotify music containing album art, track names, album title and other metadata about the songs. Just copy the Spotify link, whether it's a single song, an album, etc. As soon as your downloads are complete you will be notified!

## Music Sourcing

Downtify uses [SpotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) to download music, which in turn uses YouTube as a download source. This method is used to avoid issues related to downloading music from Spotify.

## Usage

### Docker CLI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to change the path `/path/to/downloads` in the command below to the path on your computer where you want to view the downloaded songs.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name downtify -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads ghcr.io/henriquesebastiao/downtify
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  downtify:
    container_name: downtify
    image: ghcr.io/henriquesebastiao/downtify:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/downloads:/downloads
```

Change the value `./path/to/downloads` to the directory on your machine where you want the downloaded songs to be saved.

Now you can access Downtify at http://localhost:8000/

You can also set a custom port for the web interface via the `DOWNTIFY_PORT` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - '8000:30321'
environment:
  - DOWNTIFY_PORT=30321 
```

> [!TIP]
> Downtify is also available in the app store of all major self-hosted home server OS like [Umbrel](https://apps.umbrel.com/app/downtify) and [CasaOS](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/).

## Possible problems and solutions

**Problem:** Downtify cannot download music, error: `application has reached a rate/request limit`.

**Quick Fix: Use Your Own Client ID and Secret**

To avoid these issues, we recommend using your own client ID and secret from Spotify. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Visit the Spotify Developer Dashboard**: Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. **Log In**: Sign in or create a Spotify account.
3. **Create a New App**: Click "Create an App" and fill in the details. (Set APIs used to Web API and Redirect URIs to `http://127.0.0.1:9900/` (or whatever you want to use))
4. **Get Your Credentials**: Copy your client ID and secret.

**Run Downtify passing your client ID and client secret as environment variables:**

Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name downtify -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads -e CLIENT_ID=your_client_id -e CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret ghcr.io/henriquesebastiao/downtify
```

Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  downtify:
    container_name: downtify
    image: ghcr.io/henriquesebastiao/downtify:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/downloads:/downloads
    environment:
      - CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
      - CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

Replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with the values you obtained from Spotify.
